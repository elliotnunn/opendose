# Future thoughts for baypk

The MANUAL/ETA dichotomy missed a neat insight: that after we have set
up context, the generation of ETAs can be an interactive command. Hell,
this could even be mediated by Unix job control if we're clever. Like
so:

  - ETA 0 0 0
  - GENETA 100
  - GENETA 100 1000000

True interactivity should be reserved for a shell user, though. I do not
think that a long-running and interacting "God" process is necessary.

Also -- I can ditch my "LEVEL" special case. This would allow to peform
Bayesian voodoo on *any* list of ETAs that we find, making the process
more orthogonal.

By the way: the process should quit when it reaches EOF! This is a way
to mark where the end of input corresponds with the end of output. I
don't think that there is a better way to do this.
